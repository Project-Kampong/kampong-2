                Project Kampong is a youth-led platform dedicated to connecting
                young Singaporean leaders to build social good initiatives,
                together.

                    <p>
                        Formed in Sept 2019, a result of the Youth Action Challenge under
                        the Ministry of Culture, Community, and Youth (MCCY), National
                        Youth Council (NYC) and People’s Association Youth Movement
                        (PAYM). PKG hopes to understand the existing gaps in the
                        communication & information network systems which are utilized in
                        the Social Sector in Singapore.

                    <p>
                        Our platform seeks to serve as an integrative shared central
                        platform – starting by creating visibility on completed and
                        ongoing social good activities/initiatives. The aim of PKG is to
                        lower the barrier for stakeholders to collaborate and create
                        sustainable projects with trackable impacts.

                        The current members of Project Kampong met each other at the YAC
                        workshops hosted, ideated and formed Project Kampong.

                        In Jan 2020, Project Kampong was chosen as one of the twelve
                        semi-finalists, winning S$30K to build our ideal Singapore.
                        Currently, we are in the midst of recruiting new members to join
                        us in our cause of building a better Singapore for all.

                        Project Kampong is an online platform aggregator for youths to
                        connect, collaborate and create social good initiatives for the
                        benefit of their respective communities. Through skills and idea
                        matching and intuitive progress tracking, we aim to be an online
                        platform that collates and promotes collaboration.

                        As part of the Singapore’s TogetherSG movement, having a shared
                        central network system is crucial towards the aim of community
                        development. Collaborative systems and Visibility are key areas in
                        which focus, and resources should be poured into. Having an asset
                        mapping tool is essential towards any initiatives or goals served
                        by platforms like Project Kampong.

                        Current providers include Volunteer.sg & Giving.sg. However, these
                        platforms are not able to fully support the growth of initiatives
                        but are instead a depository of resources to tap on for manpower
                        and funds respectively. PKG would like to build capacity to meet
                        the information visibility gap in the social sector. Being an
                        aggregator or ecosystem builder is a growing trend with the likes
                        of Trybe and A Good Space. However, the ecosystems in which these
                        organizations have built are not available openly.

                        The restriction of such information has resulted in a lack of
                        benchmarking in efforts directed towards addressing social issues.
                        There is uncertainty as to who and how is actively working towards
                        solving that problem. The lack of visibility and communication
                        results in similar initiatives being created and sometimes funded
                        from the same source.
